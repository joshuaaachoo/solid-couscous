ðŸŽ® Temporal Ward Data Collection Interface

Controls:
- Press 'S' to start recording a ward placement sequence
- Move your champion around (data will be automatically tracked)
- Press 'W' when you place a ward
- Enter ward details (type, position)
- Sequence automatically saves

Usage:
1. Start League game
2. Run this script
3. Press 'S' when you're about to place a ward
4. Move normally and place the ward
5. Press 'W' and enter details
6. Repeat for each ward placement

This will build your temporal training dataset!
